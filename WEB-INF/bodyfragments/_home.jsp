		<p class="lead">System Science and Engineering has emerged as a
			research field that covers a wide spectrum of modern technology. A
			system can be considered as a collection of entities and their
			interrelationships gathered together to form a whole greater than the
			sum of the entities. It also involves people, organizations,
			cultures, activities and interrelationships among them. While systems
			composed of autonomous subsystems are not new, increased data
			density, connectivity and ubiquitous computational resources have
			increased their interdependence and interaction complexity. This has
			in turn made the already difficult job of planning, developing and
			deploying complex systems even more difficult. Technology advancement
			not only provides opportunities for improving system capabilities but
			also introduces development risks that must be weighed and managed.
			Thus, it is our goal to bring together scholars from all areas to
			have a forum to discuss, demonstrate and exchange research ideas in
			the scope of system science and engineering. The International
			Conference on System Science and Engineering 2017 (ICSSE 2017) is an
			international conference that will take place in Ho Chi Minh City
			during July 21-23, 2017. This event will provide a great opportunity
			for scientists, engineers, and practitioners from all over the world
			to present the latest system design concepts, research results,
			developments and applications, as well as to facilitate interactions
			between scholars and practitioners. ICSSE 2017 will feature plenary
			speeches in emerging technology topics given by world renowned
			scholars. The proceedings of ICSSE 2017 will be published by the IEEE
			with EI indexing. In addition, selected high-quality papers will be
			published by special issues of SCI-indexed journals. ICSSE PUBLISHED
